        New antibody helps block Covid transmission in cells: Study 
    </h3>
    <h5>Feb 15,2022</h5>
    <p>
        Researchers have engineered a novel antibody that can directly interfere with and block the 
        cell-to-cell transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The antibody, FuG1, 
        targets the enzyme furin, which the virus uses for its efficient chain of infections in human cells. 
        The approach, described recently in the journal Microbiology Spectrum, could be added to existing 
        SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktails for greater function against emerging variants. "We developed an 
        approach that interferes with the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2," said senior author of the study 
        Jogender Tushir-Singh from the University of California (UC), Davis in the US. "The COVID-19 vaccines 
        are a great lifesaver in reducing hospitalisations and severe illness. Yet, we are now learning that 
        they may not be as effective in controlling the transmissibility of the virus," Tushir-Singh said. 
        The researchers noted that engineered FuG1 antibody competitively interferes with the furin function 
        needed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to become highly transmissible.

    <h3>No mandatory Covid testing for incoming passengers from February 15 in Assam </h3>
    <h5>Feb 15,2022</h5>
    <p>
        The Assam government has said mandatory testing for COVID-19 at airports, railway stations and 
        hospitals will stop from Tuesday, but those with symptoms may opt for tests on a voluntary basis. 
        In an order issued on Monday, Assam Health & Family Welfare Principal Secretary Anurag Goel said the 
        COVID-19 positivity rate is gradually decreasing in the state and the country. "Mandatory testing on 
        arrival at airports, railway stations, road border points, etc shall be discontinued. However, 
        symptomatic patients are requested to test for COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes voluntarily, at any 
        recognised testing facility," he said. Likewise, compulsory testing for any patient coming to hospitals
        for treatment will also be discontinued. The relaxations will come into force from Tuesday and will be 
        reviewed with changing scenarios in future. At present, strict containment measures, including 
        screening of incoming passengers at airports, railway stations and road entry points, are being 
        conducted in Assam to prevent the spread of the virus.
