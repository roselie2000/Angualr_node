        <p>
        Abdul Kalam had to struggle a lot to reach the success he has achieved in his career. 
        He has been a live manifestation of the strength he describes in this quote. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen 
        Abdul Kalam or A.P.J Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October, 1931 to a humble Tamil Muslim family. 
        He had to sell newspapers his his childhood in order to manage the finances of the family. He was an 
        average student in school but his keen interest in studies and his hard work are what helped him 
        achieve success in his career.
        Kalam graduated in Physics from Tiruchirapalli’s St Joseph’s College, which was affiliated with the 
        University of Madras, in 1954. In the year 1955, Kalam pursued Aerospace Engineering from Madras 
        Institute of Technology. Kalam wanted to become a fighter pilot for IAF but missed the opportunity as 
        there were only eight positions and Kalam qualified ninth.

        Kalam’s journey to become the ‘missile man of India’ had its trials and tribulations and yet he 
        attained his goal because of his singleminded devotion. After he completed his engineering, he joined 
        DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment as a scientist. He also designed a helicopter for the 
        Indian Army in the beginning of his career. Kalam was still not sure of his career choice. In 1969, 
        Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). In ISRO, he headed the project 
        of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). The growth of Kalam began here from a mere 
        scientist to become the missile man of India itself. He headed several successful launches and started
        gaining recognition in relevant circles.

        Kalam was the chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. Under this 
        mission, Kalam helped to develop Agni and Prithvi missiles. Kalam was also the Chief Scientific 
        Adviser to the Secretary of DRDO and to the Prime Minister. The Pokhran-II tests were conducted in 
        the same period. These subsequent successes made Kalam one of the most popular scientists in media.

        speed of Mach 7. It is being developed by Indo Russian unit BrahMos Aerospace. There couldn’t be a 
        greater tribute to a man who has been responsible for such a progress in missile engineering in India.
